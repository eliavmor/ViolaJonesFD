# Viola Jones 
This repo contains an end-to-end implementation of the Viola Jones algorithm for real-time face detection. As part of of my passion to CV algorithms, I challenged myself to implement a real-time algorithm for face detection from *scratch*.
In this repo you will find everyhing that is needed in order to fully train the Viola Jonas.
* Filter classes
* Weak and strong classifier class
* Data collection scripts 
* Filter generation scripts
* and more.. 

In order to run the code in real-time mode please follow the following steps:
## Step 1 
1. unzip filter.zip
2. pickle.zip

## Step 2 
cd scripts

## Strp 3
python main.py # notice that you can update the parmaters under the __main__ setion in order to train/test you algorithm (please add your own data train/test data under data/train and data/test respectivly).

Enjoy!
